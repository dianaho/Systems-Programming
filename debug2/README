Errors
--------------------
1)  Error:  Undefined symbol: numOfChars 
    File:   main.c   
    Line#:  60
    Fix:    The variable numOfChars was declared in the file count.c
            To use this variable in main, I had to declare numOfChars
            as an extern variable before the main function.

            
2)  Error:  Function returns pointer to automatic 
    File:   main.c
    Line#:  35
    Fix:    The function in main exits if argc does not equal the required
            number of arguments. However, count.c wanted to return a pointer
            to the local array, which causes this error. To fix this, I made
            the array in count.c static instead of local:
                static int asctb[ASCII] = {0};


3)  Error:  Implicit function declaration: strlen  
    File:   count.c
    Line#:  28
    Fix:    The loop was calling the strlen function defined in string.h
            but failed to include the library, which I just included:
                #include <string.h>

     
4)  Error:  Running the program with any arbitrary string will print out
            "appeared 0 times" without printing out the character that
            appears.
    File:   main.c
    Line#:  53
    Fix:    The "if" statement had two print statements following its
            condition but failed to enclose these two in brackets, so
            only one statement would print if count[j] existed else the
            second print statement would print. To fix this, I included
            the {} brackets before and after the two statements and
            the numOfChars++ line.


5)  Error:  Running the program with a string will print out way too many
            lines, having the wrong output overall.
    File:   main.c
    Line#:  52
    Fix:    The static array in count.c has size of ASCII. Using the
            condition sizeof(count) will always return a size of 4
            since count is a pointer and the size of a pointer is 4.
            To fix, I changed the condition to be a max value of ASCII.
                for (j=0; j < ASCII; j++)
